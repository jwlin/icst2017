    <p>In accordance with applicable state and local laws, we are required to charge sales tax in localities where Dick's Sporting Goods, Inc. has operations. Dick's Sporting Goods, Inc. does not benefit from the collection of sales tax and we remit all taxes collected directly to the appropriate taxing jurisdiction.</p>
    <p>As a general rule, it is the laws of the state of delivery that determine whether sales tax will be due on your transaction.</p>
    <p>Taxes that appear in your online order confirmation are estimated. Because orders may be fulfilled from multiple locations across the U.S., the actual taxes charged to your credit card will be calculated based on the applicable state and local sales taxes when your order is shipped.</p>
    <p>The terms contained herein are subject to change as the taxation of online transactions is continually evolving. Dick's Sporting Goods, Inc. strives to comply with state and local tax laws as they exist currently and continues to monitor and update its taxation policies as those laws change.</p>
    <h2>STATES WHERE DICK'S SPORTING GOODS, INC COLLECTS SALES TAXES</h2>
    <p>Orders shipped to AL, AZ, AR, CA, CO, CT, FL, GA, ID, IA, IL, IN, KS, KY, LA, MA, MD, ME, MI, MN, MO, MS, NC, NE, NJ, NM, NV, NY, OH, OK, PA, RI, SC, TN, TX, UT, VA, VT, WA, WI, or WV will have all applicable state and local sales tax added to your total order, and to related shipping and handling charges where appropriate.</p>
    <h2>STATES WHERE DICK'S SPORTING GOODS INC. DOES NOT COLLECT SALES TAXES</h2>
    <p>Dick's Sporting Goods, Inc. does not collect sales or use tax in all states. For states imposing sales or use taxes, your purchase may be subject to use tax unless it is specifically exempt from taxation. Your purchase is not exempt merely because it is made over the Internet or by other remote means. Many states require purchasers to file a sales/use tax return at the end of the year, reporting all of the taxable purchases that were not taxed, and to pay the tax on those purchases.</p>
    <p>You may have a tax obligation in states where Dick's Sporting Goods, Inc. does not collect sales tax. Details of how to report these taxes may be found at the websites of your respective taxing jurisdictions.</p>
    <p>We do not charge sales tax on the purchase of Gift Certificates; however, items paid for with Gift Certificates will be taxed if shipped to addresses in the states or regions mentioned above.</p>

              <li>If the parties don’t reach an agreed upon solution pursuant to the dispute-resolution contemplated in Section 20(a) of these Terms, you and DICK’s each agree  that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to the Sites (including, without limitation, DICK'S digital operations at or through our websites, our mobile/tablet sites, our social media presence, our Scorecard program, our applications, and our stores/locations for each member of our Family of Businesses), or these Terms or the breach, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof, including the determination of the scope or applicability of this agreement to arbitrate, shall be determined by binding arbitration before one arbitrator.   The arbitration shall be administered by JAMS pursuant to JAMS' Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures.  Judgment on the Award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. This clause shall not preclude parties from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from a court of appropriate jurisdiction.  By agreeing to arbitration, the parties understand and agree that they are waiving their rights to maintain other available resolution processes, such as a court action or administrative proceeding, to settle their disputes. We strive to offer a fundamentally-fair arbitration hearing process. For small claims (i.e., up to $10,000), in addition to your right to bring small claims court actions as noted below, We believe this can often be satisfied when hearings are conducted via electronic or telephonic means or by a submission of documents in lieu of a personal appearance by the parties.  However the arbitrator shall have discretionary authority to require a face-to-face meeting, if it determines that such face to face meeting is necessary for a fundamentally fair hearing.  Notwithstanding DICK’S right to modify these Terms, DICK’S agrees that Dick’s may not modify these arbitration provisions without notice to you and your agreement to such changes. Further, any such modification to the dispute and/or arbitration requirements in Section 20 or to this Section 21 shall not apply to claims arising prior to the date of such modification and any such changes shall not affect your prior election to opt out of arbitration as provided below.  In connection with these arbitration provisions, the parties agree as follows:
                <ol>
                  <li>This arbitration agreement is reciprocally binding on all parties such that both you and We are required to arbitrate claims;</li>
                  <li>Remedies that would otherwise be available to the parties under applicable federal, state or local laws remain available under this arbitration clause;</li>
                  <li>The arbitrator must be neutral and the parties will each have a reasonable opportunity to participate in the process of choosing the arbitrator;</li>
                  <li>You have a right to an in-person hearing in your hometown area within the United States;</li>
                  <li>You have the right to the use of counsel of your choosing if you so elect;</li>
                  <li>The parties are permitted the discovery or exchange of non-privileged information relevant to the dispute in accordance with JAMS procedures; and</li>
                  <li>The arbitrator's award will consist of a written statement stating the disposition of each claim. The award will also provide a concise written statement of the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.</li>
                </ol>
              </li>
              <li><u>Arbitration Filing Fees.</u> If you initiate the arbitration, to the extent the filing fee for the arbitration exceeds the lesser of $250 or the cost of filing a lawsuit, DICK’S will pay the additional cost.  A request for payment of any such fees should be submitted to JAMS along with your form for initiating the arbitration, and We will make arrangements to pay all necessary fees directly to JAMS.   All other costs of the arbitration will be borne by Us including any remaining JAMS Case Management Fee and all professional fees for the arbitrator's services. You will be responsible for your own attorney fees and expenses however the arbitration rules also permit you to recover attorney’s fees in certain cases.   We will not require you to reimburse our fees and costs if you do not prevail.  If we are the claiming party initiating an arbitration against you, We will pay all costs associated with the arbitration (other than your attorneys’ fees and expenses unless permitted to be recovered under the arbitration rules).</li>
              <li><u>Waiver of Certain Rights from Court.</u> The parties understand that, absent this mandatory provision, they would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial.  They further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.</li>
              <li><u><strong>Class Action Waiver.</strong></u> The parties further agree that any arbitration shall be conducted in their individual capacities only and not as a class action or other representative action, and the parties expressly waive their right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis.  If any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in this paragraph is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provision set forth above shall be deemed null and void in its entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes.</li>
              <li><u>Exception - Small Claims Court Claims.</u> Notwithstanding the parties' decision to resolve all disputes through arbitration, either party may also seek relief in a small claims court for disputes or claims within the scope of that court's jurisdiction.  Any appeal of the decision in such small claims court shall be subject to these arbitration provisions.</li>
              <li><u>30-Day Right to Opt-Out.</u> You have the right to opt-out and not be bound by the arbitration and class action waiver provisions set forth in this Section 21 by sending written notice of your decision to opt-out to the following address via certified mail:  Dick's Sporting Goods, Inc., 345 Court Street, Coraopolis, PA 15108, Attention: Legal Department.  The notice must be sent within thirty (30) days of your first use of a Site after the effective date of these Terms, otherwise you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with the terms of those Sections.  If you opt-out of these arbitration provisions, DICK’S also will not be bound by them.</li>
            </ol>
<strong>YOU AGREE THAT BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, IN PARTICULAR THE AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE, YOU ARE WAIVING THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION AND THAT YOU MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST DICK’S ONLY IN YOUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.  ANY ARBITRATION OR OTHER ACTION WILL TAKE PLACE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS; CLASS ARBITRATIONS AND CLASS ACTIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED.  YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU INTEND TO BE LEGALLY BOUND AND, IN ADDITION TO OTHER GOOD AND VALUABLE CONSIDERATION, YOU AGREE THAT DICK’S AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE CLAIMS CONSTITUTES CONSIDERATION FOR SUCH WAIVER.</strong>
          </li>
          <li><u>Admissibility.</u> A printed version of these Terms shall be admissible in judicial and administrative proceedings and in arbitration proceedings based upon or relating to these Terms to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form.</li>
          <li><u>Waiver and Severability.</u> No waiver by either party of any term or condition set forth in these Terms shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or condition or a waiver of any other term or condition, and any failure of a party to assert a right or provision under these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of these Terms is held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be eliminated or limited to the minimum extent such that the remaining provisions of these Terms will continue in full force and effect.</li>
          <li><u>Entire Agreement.</u> These Terms and our Privacy Policy and Additional Terms constitute the sole and entire agreement between you and DICK'S with respect to the Sites and supersede all prior and contemporaneous understandings, agreements, representations and warranties, both written and oral, with respect to the Site.</li>
          <li><u>Termination.</u> You or DICK'S may suspend or terminate your account or your use/access of a Site at any time, for any reason or for no reason. You are personally liable for any activity prior to such termination, including any orders that you place or charges that you incur prior to termination. DICK'S reserves the right to change, suspend, or discontinue all or any aspect of the Sites at any time without notice except as provided in these Terms.</li>

          <li><u>Disputes, Choice of Law, and Jurisdiction.</u>
          <ol type="a">
            <li><u>Initial Dispute Resolution.</u>  We are available by email at <a href="mailto:Customer.Service@dickssportinggoods.com">Customer.Service@dickssportinggoods.com</a> to address any concerns you may have regarding your use of the Sites. Most concerns may be quickly resolved in this manner. The parties shall use their best efforts to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement directly through consultation and good faith negotiations, which shall be a precondition to either party initiating a lawsuit or arbitration.  Any matter and/or dispute relating in any way to your visit to or interaction with a Site, including compliance with these Terms, which is not so resolved shall be submitted to binding confidential arbitration as provided in Section 21 (herein).</li>
            <li><u>Choice of Law and Courts for Non-Arbitrated Disputes.</u>Unless expressly addressed in the Additional Terms, these Terms supersede any other agreement between you and DICK'S to the extent necessary to resolve any inconsistency or ambiguity between them. The Sites are administered by DICK'S from its offices in Pennsylvania. Notwithstanding the arbitration provisions in Section 21,  to the extent you have in any manner violated or threatened to violate our intellectual property rights, We may seek injunctive or other appropriate relief in the state courts of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania or the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania, and you consent to exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue in such courts.</li>
          </ol>
          ANY CAUSE OF ACTION OR CLAIM YOU MAY HAVE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS OR THE SITE MUST BE COMMENCED WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES, OTHERWISE, SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION OR CLAIM IS PERMANENTLY BARRED.
          </li>
          <li><u>Arbitration.</u> 
            <ol type="a">
              <li>If the parties don’t reach an agreed upon solution pursuant to the dispute-resolution contemplated in Section 20(a) of these Terms, you and DICK’s each agree  that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to our products or services or the Sites (including, without limitation, DICK'S digital operations at or through our websites, our mobile/tablet sites, our social media presence, our Scorecard program, our applications, and our stores/locations for each member of our Family of Businesses), or these Terms or the breach, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof, shall be determined by binding arbitration before one arbitrator.   The arbitration shall be administered by JAMS pursuant to JAMS' Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures.  Judgment on the Award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. By agreeing to arbitration, the parties understand and agree that they are waiving their rights to maintain other available resolution processes, such as a court action or administrative proceeding, to settle their disputes. We strive to offer a fundamentally-fair arbitration hearing process. For small claims (i.e., up to $10,000), in addition to your right to bring small claims court actions as noted below, We believe this can often be satisfied when hearings are conducted via electronic or telephonic means or by a submission of documents in lieu of a personal appearance by the parties.  However the arbitrator shall have discretionary authority to require a face-to-face meeting, if it determines that such face to face meeting is necessary for a fundamentally fair hearing.  Notwithstanding DICK’S right to modify these Terms, DICK’S agrees that Dick’s may not modify these arbitration provisions without notice to you and your agreement to such changes. Further, any such modification to the dispute and/or arbitration requirements in Section 20 or to this Section 21 shall not apply to claims arising prior to the date of such modification and any such changes shall not affect your prior election to opt out of arbitration as provided below.  In connection with these arbitration provisions, the parties agree as follows:
                <ol>
                  <li>This arbitration agreement is reciprocally binding on all parties such that both you and We are required to arbitrate claims;</li>
                  <li>Remedies that would otherwise be available to the parties under applicable federal, state or local laws, including the recovery of attorney’s fees, remain available under this arbitration clause;</li>
                  <li>The arbitrator must be neutral and the parties will each have a reasonable opportunity to participate in the process of choosing the arbitrator;</li>
                  <li>You have a right to an in-person hearing in your hometown area within the United States;</li>
                  <li>You have the right to the use of counsel of your choosing at your own expense if you so elect, and to recover attorneys’ fees and expenses of arbitration to the extent provided by law;</li>
                  <li>The parties are permitted the discovery or exchange of non-privileged information relevant to the dispute in accordance with JAMS procedures; and</li>
                  <li>The arbitrator's award will consist of a written statement stating the disposition of each claim. The award will also provide a concise written statement of the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.</li>
                </ol>
              </li>
              <li><u>Arbitration Filing Fees.</u> If you initiate the arbitration, to the extent the filing fee for the arbitration exceeds the lesser of $250 or the cost of filing a lawsuit, DICK’S will pay the additional cost.  A request for payment of any such fees should be submitted to JAMS along with your form for initiating the arbitration, and We will make arrangements to pay all necessary fees directly to JAMS.   All other costs of the arbitration will be borne by Us including any remaining JAMS Case Management Fee and all professional fees for the arbitrator's services. You will be responsible for your own attorney fees and expenses unless the arbitration rules or applicable law permit you to recover your attorney’s fees.  We will not require you to reimburse our fees and costs if you do not prevail.  If we are the claiming party initiating an arbitration against you, We will pay all costs associated with the arbitration (other than your attorneys’ fees and expenses unless permitted to be recovered under the arbitration rules or applicable law).</li>
              <li><u>Waiver of Certain Rights from Court.</u> The parties understand that, absent this mandatory provision, they would have the right to sue in court. Court proceedings generally provide greater discovery rights, a judge or jury trial, and could provide greater opportunity for appellate review.  They further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation.</li>
              <li><u><strong>Class Action Waiver.</strong></u> The parties further agree that any arbitration shall be conducted in their individual capacities only and not as a class action or other representative action, and the parties expressly waive their right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis.</li>
              <li><u>Exception - Small Claims Court Claims.</u> Notwithstanding the parties' decision to resolve all disputes through arbitration, either party may also seek relief in a small claims court for disputes or claims within the scope of that court's jurisdiction.  Any appeal of the decision in such small claims court shall be subject to these arbitration provisions.</li>
              <li><u>30-Day Right to Opt-Out.</u> You have the right to opt-out and not be bound by the arbitration and class action waiver provisions set forth in this Section 21 by sending written notice of your decision to opt-out to the following address via certified mail:  Dick's Sporting Goods, Inc., 345 Court Street, Coraopolis, PA 15108, Attention: Legal Department.  The notice must be sent within thirty (30) days of your first use of a Site after the effective date of these Terms, otherwise you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with the terms of those Sections.  If you opt-out of these arbitration provisions, DICK’S also will not be bound by them.</li>
            </ol>
<strong>YOU AGREE THAT BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, IN PARTICULAR THE AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE, YOU ARE WAIVING THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION AND THAT YOU MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST DICK’S ONLY IN YOUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.  ANY ARBITRATION OR OTHER ACTION WILL TAKE PLACE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS; CLASS ARBITRATIONS AND CLASS ACTIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED.  YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU INTEND TO BE LEGALLY BOUND AND, IN ADDITION TO OTHER GOOD AND VALUABLE CONSIDERATION, YOU AGREE THAT DICK’S AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE CLAIMS CONSTITUTES CONSIDERATION FOR SUCH WAIVER. THE CLASS ACTION WAIVER IS AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE AND CAN NOT BE SEVERED FROM THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES.</strong>
          </li>
          <li><u>Admissibility.</u> A printed version of these Terms shall be admissible in judicial and administrative proceedings and in arbitration proceedings based upon or relating to these Terms to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form.</li>
          <li><u>Waiver and Severability.</u> No waiver by either party of any term or condition set forth in these Terms shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or condition or a waiver of any other term or condition, and any failure of a party to assert a right or provision under these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.</li>
          <li><u>Entire Agreement.</u> These Terms and our Privacy Policy and Additional Terms constitute the sole and entire agreement between you and DICK'S with respect to the Sites and supersede all prior and contemporaneous understandings, agreements, representations and warranties, both written and oral, with respect to the Site.</li>
          <li><u>Termination.</u> You or DICK'S may suspend or terminate your account or your use/access of a Site at any time, for any reason or for no reason. You are personally liable for any activity prior to such termination, including any orders that you place or charges that you incur prior to termination. DICK'S reserves the right to change, suspend, or discontinue all or any aspect of the Sites at any time without notice except as provided in these Terms.</li>
